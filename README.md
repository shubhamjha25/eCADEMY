## PROJECT SETUP
**1.** Fork [this](https://github.com/shubhamjha25/eCADEMY) repository. üç¥ <br />

**2.** Clone the forked repository on your local machine by writing the following command on your terminal: üë®üèª‚Äçüíª <br />
```
git clone https://github.com/<your_user_name>/eCADEMY.git
```

**3.** Navigate to the project directory :file_folder: .

```
cd eCADEMY
```

**4.** Go to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) Console and Create a New Project

**5.** Enable _User Authentication_ and _Firestore Database_.

**6.** Put Your Firebase API Access Keys inside ./src/firebase.js (or you may store them as the environment variables)
```
const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
    authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
    projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
    storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
    messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
    appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
    measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
};
```

**7.** Install the necessary _node_modules_
```
npm install
```

**8.** Run the `localhost` server
```
npm start
```

After this complete setup, you will find that your react sever is up and running on the port **3000** which can be accessed through [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) <br />
You are good to go! üëç
